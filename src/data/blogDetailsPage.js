     " Remember that mind-bending video where water defied gravity, refusing to spill even when flipped upside down? The internet exploded, and Bhautiki Plus, the Gwalior-based EdTech brand behind it all, was celebrating a 6 million+ impression campaign that swept across social media like wildfire!

This campaign wasn't just about views; it was about sparking curiosity, igniting imaginations, and proving that learning can be both fun and thought-provoking.
